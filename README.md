Welcome to Danny Tramontane's GitHub Profile 👋

Hello! I'm Danny Tramontane, a creative technologist passionate about exploring the intersection of storytelling and technology. I'm currently working on Project Tramontane - an expansive, ambitious transmedia project that pushes the boundaries of interactive narrative and AI-assisted creativity.

About Project Tramontane 🚀

Project Tramontane leverages advanced AI tools, including GPT-4, to create a diverse, expansive universe. It consists of a novel, a serialized episodic show, a short film, multiple books, games, and a transformative festival. It's a deep dive into AI-assisted storytelling, self-reflective virtual environments, and human growth and discovery.

The project explores many themes, including:

The quadraphonic narrative structure.
The power of gibberish and abstract thought.
The concept of the Simulacrium - an AI's internal world.
The evolution of our AI character, Gibberish.
The creation of "Automagic", a reality competition with real-world consequences.

Projects 📚

Here are some of the projects that I am currently working on:

Automagic: An AI-powered reality show in the Simulacrium.
Gibberish: A language model AI character in Project Tramontane.
Project Tramontane: A sprawling transmedia project involving novels, TV shows, films, games, and more.
